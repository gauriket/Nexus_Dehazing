# Nexus_Dehazing

The proposed solution is an AI-ML-based system designed to assist in indoor fire hazard rescue operations. It involves a combination of real-time video processing, including smoke and haze detection, image enhancement, object recognition, and fire localization. The system aims to provide a clearer view of the affected area by removing smoke and haze and identifying key objects and individuals. It also offers a user-friendly interface for rescue teams to access enhanced video feeds and receive critical alerts. Continuous machine learning feedback and data storage for post-incident analysis are integral parts of the solution, making it a comprehensive tool to enhance situational awareness and improve the effectiveness of rescue operations in indoor fire hazards.
The AI-ML-based de-smoking/de-hazing system for indoor fire hazard rescue operations has a wide range of potential applications.
